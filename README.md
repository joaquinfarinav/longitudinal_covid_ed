# longitudinal_covid_ed
This study investigates the longitudinal educational impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020, 2021) and one subsequent recovery year (2022) on Chilean student cohorts. Using a novel census-level dataset with 12 repeating survey items from students, teachers, and parents, we employ a difference-in-differences approach comparing cohorts affected by the pandemic to older cohorts who had completed their education before the pandemic. Initial results indicate marked variations in academic performance, socio-emotional well-being, parental engagement, and teacher perceptions across the cohorts. Test scores and school-specific responses to the pandemic are accounted for. The findings highlight the profound and multifaceted educational repercussions of extended interruptions.
